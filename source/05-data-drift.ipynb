    "\n",
    "Suppose the spam generator becomes more intelligent and begins producing prose which looks \"more legitimate\" than before. Models with changing data need to be monitored to ensure that the model is still performing as expected. Data drift can be seen in different forms. To illustrate a few: \n",
    " + The structure of data may change. Maybe spam emails start utilizing photo attachments rather than text. Since our model is based off of text within the email, it would likely start performing very poorly.\n",
    " + Data can change meaning, even if structure does not. (example)\n",
    " + Feature may change. Features that are previously infrequent may become more frequent, or vice versa. One (unlikely) drift could be that all modern spam emails start containing the word \"coffee\" and never the word \"tree.\" This could be an important insight to include in our model. \n",
    " \n",
    "Data drift appears in many subtle ways, causing models to become useless without ever notifying the user that an error has occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start exploring data drift by importing the data used in previous notebooks."
